It participates in the activation of inflammasomes and the cleavage of interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²), a key cytokine in inflammatory responses. This indicates that CASP8 has roles beyond cell death, contributing to immune signaling and inflammation [2][5].

4. **Immune Cell Activation**:
   - CASP8 is essential for optimal transcription of certain inflammatory cytokines independently of its apoptotic function. It plays a role in T cell activation and signaling pathways involving NF-ÎºB, which is crucial for the adaptive immune response [5]. The deficiency of CASP8 can lead to impaired lymphocyte activation and increased susceptibility to infections due to its role in promoting immune cell responses.

5. **Caspase-8 Deficiency State (CEDS)**:
   - Mutations or deficiencies in CASP8 can lead to immunodeficient phenotypes, characterized by recurrent infections and lymphadenopathy, as seen in conditions like Caspase Eight Deficiency State (CEDS). This highlights the importance of CASP8 in maintaining effective immune function [5].

In summary, CASP8 is integral to regulating apoptosis and inflammation within the immune system. Its functions extend beyond cell death to include roles in cytokine production, immune cell activation, and the regulation of inflammatory responses, making it a critical component of both innate and adaptive immunity.
