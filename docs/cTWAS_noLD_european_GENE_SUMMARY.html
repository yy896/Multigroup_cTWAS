The results in this page were generated with repository version

See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made
to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for
the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results
(you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or
<code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown
file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it
depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results
were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .DS_Store
    Ignored:    .Rhistory

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not
included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to
have uncommitted changes.

<h3>ZC3H12A</h3>
<p>ZC3H12A, encoding the MCPIP1 protein, has been studied in the context
of various cancers, including prostate cancer. Here are some insights
into its role:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Tumor Suppressor Function: MCPIP1 is often considered to have
tumor suppressor properties. Its ability to degrade mRNAs of
pro-inflammatory cytokines and other oncogenic factors can help inhibit
tumor growth and progression.</p></li>
<li><p>Regulation of Inflammation: Chronic inflammation is a known risk
factor for cancer development, including prostate cancer. By modulating
