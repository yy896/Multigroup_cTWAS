Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development
and connecting the code version to the results is critical for
reproducibility.

The results in this page were generated with repository version
<a href="https://github.com/yy896/Multigroup_cTWAS/tree/585c17bf2b386137f7bde56d99be1de653f69fe8" target="_blank">585c17b</a>.
See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made
to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for
the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results
(you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or
<code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown
file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it
depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results
were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .DS_Store
    Ignored:    .Rhistory
    Ignored:    analysis/.DS_Store
    Ignored:    analysis/.Rhistory

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not
included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to
have uncommitted changes.

<h2>Immune Functions</h2>
<div id="cep250" class="section level3">
<h3>CEP250</h3>
<p>CEP250, also known as C-Nap1 (Centrosomal Nek2-Associated Protein 1),
plays a role in immune function, particularly in relation to immune
cells. Here’s what we know about its immune-related functions:</p>
<p><strong>Immune Cell Expression</strong></p>
<p>CEP250 is expressed in various immune cells and tissues:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is found in bone marrow cells involved in innate immune
responses[2].</li>
<li>The protein is present in immune-related tissues such as the tonsil,
appendix, thymus, lymph node, and spleen[2].</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>T Cell Function</strong></p>
<p>CEP250 appears to have a specific role in T cell function:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is expressed in immune cells associated with T cell receptor
signaling[8].</li>
<li>This suggests that CEP250 may be involved in T cell activation or
regulation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Centrosome-Related Immune Functions</strong></p>
<p>As a centrosomal protein, CEP250 may indirectly influence immune cell
function through its role in cell division and organization:</p>
<ul>
<li>CEP250 is required for centriole-centriole cohesion during
interphase of the cell cycle[4].</li>
<li>It plays a crucial role in centrosome duplication and organization
during cell division[7].</li>
</ul>
<p>These centrosomal functions could be important for immune cell
proliferation and the formation of the immunological synapse, which is
critical for T cell activation and function.</p>
<p><strong>Potential Impact on Immune Response</strong></p>
<p>While not directly stated in the search results, the expression of
CEP250 in various immune cells and tissues suggests it may have broader
impacts on immune function:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its presence in bone marrow cells involved in innate immune
responses indicates a potential role in the development or function of
innate immune cells[2].</li>
<li>The expression in multiple lymphoid tissues implies that CEP250
could be involved in various aspects of adaptive immunity, beyond just T
cell function[2][8].</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s important to note that while these findings suggest
immune-related functions for CEP250, more research is needed to fully
elucidate its specific roles in immune responses. The protein’s primary
known function remains centered on its centrosomal activities, which may
indirectly influence immune cell behavior through effects on cell
division and organization.</p>

<h3>TBX1</h3>
<p>Based on the search results, TBX1 plays several important roles
related to immune function:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Thymus development: TBX1 is crucial for the normal development of
the thymus, which is a primary lymphoid organ essential for T cell
maturation and selection. Deficiency in TBX1 can lead to thymic
hypoplasia or aplasia, affecting T cell development [3].</p></li>
<li><p>T cell development: TBX1 deficiency can result in T cell
immunodeficiency, ranging from an isolated reduction in T cell count to
severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) [3].</p></li>
<li><p>Regulation of immune-related genes: As a transcription factor,
TBX1 likely regulates the expression of genes involved in immune system
development, though specific target genes are not fully elucidated
[2].</p></li>
<li><p>Association with DiGeorge Syndrome: TBX1 haploinsufficiency is
associated with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (DiGeorge Syndrome), which
includes immune system abnormalities as part of its clinical
presentation [2][3].</p></li>
<li><p>Impact on other immune-related organs: TBX1 is necessary for the
development of the parathyroid glands and is involved in the formation
of the thymus, both of which play roles in the immune system
[1][2].</p></li>
<li><p>Potential impact on NK and B cells: While TBX1 deficiency
primarily affects T cells, there may be functional compromises in NK and
B cells as well, including impaired production of specific antibodies
[3].</p></li>
<li><p>Long-term immune effects: TBX1 haploinsufficiency can lead to
persistent T cell abnormalities, including low CD8+ T cell counts and
altered CD4+ T cell populations in adulthood [3].</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, TBX1 is critical for proper immune system development,
particularly in thymus formation and T cell maturation. Its deficiency
can lead to various immunological abnormalities, primarily affecting T
cell populations but potentially impacting other aspects of the immune
system as well.</p>

<h3>MSMB</h3>
<p>Based on the search results, MSMB (microseminoprotein beta) has
several immune-related functions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Immune modulation: MSMB has immune modulating properties,
particularly through its interactions with other proteins. It binds to
immunoglobulin G (IgG) and several Cysteine-rich secretory proteins
(CRISP) family proteins, which are thought to be involved in immune
modulation[1].</p></li>
<li><p>Innate immunity: MSMB interacts with CRISP-3, which is present in
neutrophils and may play a role in the innate immune system. Decreased
levels of MSMB alongside increased CRISP-3 could be related to boosting
innate immunity in prostate cancer cells[1].</p></li>
<li><p>Natural killer cell and neutrophil activation: MSMB interacts
with monoclonal natural killer-associated antibodies and anti-FcγRIII
antibodies. It is considered a mediator of natural killer cells and an
activator of neutrophils[1].</p></li>
<li><p>Prevention of immune activation against allogeneic sperm: In the
female reproductive tract, MSMB derived from human seminal plasma and
cervical mucus interacts with IgG to prevent immune activation against
allogeneic sperm[1].</p></li>
<li><p>Regulation of IgG: In a normal prostate, the IgG binding nature
of MSMB could support the control of free IgG and its downstream
effects[1].</p></li>
<li><p>Potential impact on immune cell infiltration: While not directly
stated for MSMB, the study mentions that obesity-related genes (which
include MSMB) may lead to prostate cancer by affecting immune cell
infiltration[2].</p></li>
<li><p>Association with immune cells: MSMB expression was found to
correlate with macrophages and purity in prostate cancer[2].</p></li>
</ol>
<p>It’s important to note that while MSMB has these immune-related
functions, its primary roles appear to be related to prostate cancer
development and progression. Its expression is often decreased in
prostate cancer, and it has been studied as a potential biomarker for
prostate cancer diagnosis and prognosis[1][2].</p>

<h3>ZC3H12A</h3>
<p>The gene <strong>ZC3H12A</strong> (also known as Regnase-1) plays a
significant role in the immune system, particularly in regulating
inflammatory responses. Here are the key immune functions associated
with ZC3H12A:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Regulation of Inflammatory Cytokines</strong>:
<ul>
<li>ZC3H12A is an RNase that destabilizes mRNAs of pro-inflammatory
cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-12. This function is
crucial for controlling the duration and intensity of immune responses,
preventing excessive inflammation and potential autoimmune disorders
[1][2][3].</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Response to Toll-like Receptor (TLR) Stimulation</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The expression of ZC3H12A is induced by TLR signaling, which is
essential for recognizing microbial components and initiating immune
responses. In ZC3H12A-deficient mice, the production of IL-6 and IL-12
is significantly increased upon TLR stimulation, indicating that ZC3H12A
normally acts to limit these cytokine levels [1][2].</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Prevention of Autoimmunity</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Mice lacking ZC3H12A develop severe autoimmune symptoms, including
splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and increased serum immunoglobulin
levels. This suggests that ZC3H12A is vital for maintaining immune
homeostasis and preventing autoimmune diseases [1][2][3].</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Impact on Macrophage Function</strong>:
<ul>
<li>In macrophages from ZC3H12A-deficient mice, there is an exaggerated
production of inflammatory cytokines like IL-6 and IL-12 in response to
TLR ligands, further illustrating its role in regulating macrophage
activation and function [1][2].</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Role in B Cell Activation</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The absence of ZC3H12A leads to an increase in plasma cells and
autoantibody production, highlighting its importance in B cell
regulation during immune responses [1].</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, ZC3H12A functions as a critical regulator of immune
responses by controlling the stability of mRNAs for inflammatory
cytokines. Its activity helps prevent excessive inflammation and
autoimmunity, making it essential for maintaining immune balance.</p>

<h3>MTERF2</h3>
<p>The gene <strong>MTERF2</strong> (Mitochondrial Transcription
Termination Factor 2) has several important functions related to the
immune system, primarily through its role in mitochondrial function and
regulation of oxidative stress:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Regulation of Mitochondrial Function</strong>:
<ul>
<li>MTERF2 is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial transcription
and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). By modulating mitochondrial
function, MTERF2 plays a crucial role in energy production, which is
vital for the activation and function of immune cells, particularly
lymphocytes that require high energy levels during immune responses
[1].</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Impact on Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>MTERF2 has been implicated in controlling ROS levels within cells.
ROS are critical signaling molecules in the immune response, influencing
processes such as inflammation and apoptosis. By regulating
mitochondrial transcription and OXPHOS, MTERF2 may help maintain
appropriate ROS levels, thereby influencing immune cell activation and
responses [1].</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Potential Role in Inflammation</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Although specific studies directly linking MTERF2 to inflammation
are limited, its regulation of mitochondrial function suggests it could
play a role in modulating inflammatory responses. Mitochondrial
dysfunction is often associated with chronic inflammation, and proper
mitochondrial function is essential for resolving inflammation
effectively.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Role in Immune Cell Metabolism</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The metabolic state of immune cells is crucial for their function.
MTERF2’s involvement in mitochondrial transcription suggests it may
influence the metabolic pathways that are essential for immune cell
proliferation and differentiation.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, while the direct immune functions of MTERF2 are not
extensively characterized, its role in regulating mitochondrial
function, energy metabolism, and ROS levels indicates that it likely
contributes to immune responses by supporting the metabolic needs of
immune cells and modulating inflammatory processes. Further research
would be necessary to elucidate its specific roles within the immune
system.</p>

important immune functions, particularly related to the regulation of
immune cell activity and antitumor immunity:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Regulation of NK Cell Function</strong>:
<ul>
<li>FBXO38 enhances natural killer (NK) cell-mediated antitumor immunity
by maintaining the strength of IL-15 signaling. Its expression is
crucial for the proliferation and survival of tumor-infiltrating NK
(TINK) cells. Conditional knockout of FBXO38 in NK cells leads to
impaired proliferation and survival, resulting in accelerated tumor
growth and metastasis in mouse models[1].</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Modulation of PD-1 Levels</strong>:
<ul>
<li>FBXO38 acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for PD-1, a checkpoint protein
that negatively regulates T cell activation. By mediating the
polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation of PD-1, FBXO38 helps to
enhance T cell cytotoxicity against tumors. In T cells lacking FBXO38,
PD-1 levels are elevated, leading to reduced antitumor activity and
faster tumor progression[3][5].</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Influence on Macrophage Polarization</strong>:
<ul>
<li>FBXO38 promotes the immunosuppressive function of macrophages by
upregulating M2-like genes through MAPK and IRF4 signaling pathways.
This suggests that FBXO38 can influence macrophage polarization,
potentially contributing to a tumor-promoting environment[2].</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Impact on Tumor Development</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Deletion of FBXO38 in macrophages has been shown to block tumor
development and protect against colitis-induced inflammation, indicating
its role in regulating immune responses that can affect cancer
progression and inflammatory diseases[2].</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Therapeutic Implications</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Given its roles in regulating NK cell function and PD-1 levels,
targeting FBXO38 could have therapeutic implications for enhancing NK
cell-based cancer immunotherapy or improving responses to PD-1 blockade
therapies[1][3].</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, FBXO38 plays a critical role in modulating immune
responses by regulating NK cell activity, influencing T cell checkpoint
dynamics via PD-1 degradation, and affecting macrophage polarization.
These functions highlight its potential as a target for therapeutic
strategies in cancer immunotherapy.</p>

<h3>HLA-DQB1</h3>
<p>The gene <strong>HLA-DQB1</strong> (Human Leukocyte Antigen DQ beta
1) plays a crucial role in the immune system, particularly in the
context of antigen presentation and immune responses. Here are the key
immune functions associated with HLA-DQB1:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Antigen Presentation</strong>:
<ul>
<li>HLA-DQB1 is part of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class
II molecules, which are essential for presenting peptides derived from
extracellular proteins to CD4+ T cells. This process is vital for
initiating adaptive immune responses against pathogens, such as viruses
and bacteria [1][2].</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Formation of the DQ Heterodimer</strong>:
<ul>
<li>HLA-DQB1 combines with another MHC class II protein, HLA-DQA1, to
form a functional heterodimer (DQαβ). This complex is expressed on the
surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs), including B lymphocytes,
dendritic cells, and macrophages, facilitating the recognition of
foreign antigens by T cells [1][2].</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Polymorphism and Immune Diversity</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The HLA-DQB1 gene exhibits significant polymorphism, resulting in
various alleles that can bind different peptide fragments. This
diversity allows the immune system to recognize a wide range of
antigens, enhancing its ability to respond to diverse pathogens
[2].</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Association with Autoimmune Diseases</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Certain alleles of HLA-DQB1 are linked to increased susceptibility
to autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes, celiac disease, and
multiple sclerosis. For example, alleles like DQB1<em>0201 and
DQB1</em>0302 have been associated with a higher risk of developing
these conditions, indicating that variations in HLA-DQB1 can influence
immune tolerance and self-reactivity [1][2].</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Role in Immune Regulation</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Variations in HLA-DQB1 may also affect regulatory T cell populations
and cytokine production, influencing overall immune regulation and
response to therapies such as interferon-beta in multiple sclerosis
patients [5].</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, HLA-DQB1 is essential for effective immune function
through its role in antigen presentation, contributing to both
protective immunity and susceptibility to autoimmune diseases. Its
polymorphic nature enhances the immune system’s ability to respond to
various pathogens while also playing a role in self-tolerance
mechanisms.</p>

<h3>LIAS</h3>
<p>The gene <strong>LIAS</strong> (Lipoic Acid Synthetase) has several
immune-related functions, particularly in the context of inflammation
and atherosclerosis:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Antioxidant Role</strong>:
<ul>
<li>LIAS is responsible for synthesizing lipoic acid, a potent
antioxidant that helps reduce oxidative stress in cells. This
antioxidant capacity is crucial for maintaining immune homeostasis and
preventing excessive inflammation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Regulation of Immune Responses</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Overexpression of LIAS has been shown to significantly alleviate
atherosclerosis in mouse models. This effect is associated with an
increase in regulatory T cells (Tregs) and a reduction in T cell
infiltrates in aortic walls, suggesting that LIAS modulates the immune
response to promote a more anti-inflammatory environment.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Impact on T Cell Subsets</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The presence of higher levels of lipoic acid, facilitated by LIAS,
appears to promote the generation of Treg cells. This indicates that
LIAS may play a role in influencing T cell differentiation and function,
particularly in the context of chronic inflammatory conditions like
atherosclerosis.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Autoantibody Production</strong>:
<ul>
<li>In the context of atherosclerosis, increased levels of anti-oxidized
LDL autoantibodies were observed alongside enhanced regulatory T cell
numbers in mice with elevated LIAS expression. This suggests that LIAS
may help regulate both the adaptive immune response and antibody
production.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Therapeutic Implications</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The findings indicate that enhancing antioxidant capacity through
LIAS may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for managing
inflammatory diseases, including cardiovascular conditions characterized
by chronic inflammation.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, LIAS plays an important role in regulating immune
responses through its antioxidant functions, influencing T cell
dynamics, and potentially modulating inflammatory processes,
particularly in the context of atherosclerosis.</p>

<h3>CASP8</h3>
<p>The gene <strong>CASP8</strong> (Caspase-8) plays several critical
roles in the immune system, primarily through its functions in
apoptosis, inflammation, and immune cell signaling:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Apoptosis Regulation</strong>:
<ul>
<li>CASP8 is an initiator caspase involved in the extrinsic pathway of
apoptosis, which is triggered by death receptors such as Fas and TRAIL
receptors. Its activation leads to the execution of programmed cell
death, a vital process for eliminating damaged or infected cells,
thereby maintaining tissue homeostasis and preventing autoimmune
reactions [1][4].</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Inflammation and Necroptosis</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Beyond its role in apoptosis, CASP8 also regulates necroptosis, a
form of programmed cell death that can induce inflammation. CASP8
inhibits necroptosis mediated by RIPK3 and MLKL, thus preventing
excessive inflammatory responses that could lead to tissue damage
[2][4]. When CASP8 is dysfunctional or absent, cells may undergo
necroptosis instead of apoptosis, releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines
and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) into the surrounding
environment [1].</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Cytokine Production</strong>:
<ul>
<li>CASP8 is involved in the regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine
expression. It participates in the activation of inflammasomes and the
cleavage of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), a key cytokine in inflammatory
responses. This indicates that CASP8 has roles beyond cell death,
contributing to immune signaling and inflammation [2][5].</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Immune Cell Activation</strong>:
<ul>
<li>CASP8 is essential for optimal transcription of certain inflammatory
cytokines independently of its apoptotic function. It plays a role in T
cell activation and signaling pathways involving NF-κB, which is crucial
for the adaptive immune response [5]. The deficiency of CASP8 can lead
to impaired lymphocyte activation and increased susceptibility to
infections due to its role in promoting immune cell responses.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Caspase-8 Deficiency State (CEDS)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Mutations or deficiencies in CASP8 can lead to immunodeficient
phenotypes, characterized by recurrent infections and lymphadenopathy,
as seen in conditions like Caspase Eight Deficiency State (CEDS). This
highlights the importance of CASP8 in maintaining effective immune
function [5].</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, CASP8 is integral to regulating apoptosis and
inflammation within the immune system. Its functions extend beyond cell
death to include roles in cytokine production, immune cell activation,
and the regulation of inflammatory responses, making it a critical
component of both innate and adaptive immunity.</p>

<h3>CXXC1</h3>
<p>The gene <strong>CXXC1</strong> (CXXC finger protein 1) has several
important immune functions, particularly related to T regulatory (Treg)
cell development and function:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Regulation of Treg Cell Homeostasis</strong>:
<ul>
<li>CXXC1 is critical for the maintenance of Treg cells. Deletion of
CXXC1 in Treg cells leads to a rapid onset of autoimmune disorders
characterized by systemic inflammation and tissue damage. This indicates
that CXXC1 is essential for preventing excessive immune activation and
maintaining tolerance in the immune system [1].</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Interaction with FOXP3</strong>:
<ul>
<li>CXXC1 interacts with the transcription factor FOXP3, which is
crucial for Treg cell function. This interaction helps regulate target
genes by modulating histone modifications, specifically H3K4me3, which
is important for the expression of genes that maintain Treg cell
identity and suppressive functions [1][2].</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Epigenetic Regulation</strong>:
<ul>
<li>As a transcriptional regulator, CXXC1 binds to genomic regions of
Treg-specific genes, influencing their expression through epigenetic
mechanisms. This includes maintaining H3K4me3 modifications at key
regulatory regions, which are essential for the proper functioning of
Treg cells [2][3].</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Thymocyte Development</strong>:
<ul>
<li>CXXC1 also plays a role in thymocyte development, controlling the
expression of key survival genes necessary for T-cell receptor signaling
and overall thymocyte viability. This function is crucial for developing
a functional adaptive immune system [2].</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Influence on Inflammatory Responses</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The absence of CXXC1 results in increased expression of inflammatory
markers and genes associated with Th1-type inflammation, suggesting that
it helps regulate the balance between immune activation and tolerance
[1].</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Potential Therapeutic Target</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Given its critical role in Treg cell function and autoimmunity,
CXXC1 presents itself as a potential therapeutic target for autoimmune
diseases, where enhancing Treg function could help restore immune
balance [1].</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, CXXC1 is essential for maintaining Treg cell homeostasis
and function through its interactions with FOXP3 and its role in
epigenetic regulation. Its functions are crucial for preventing
autoimmune diseases and ensuring proper immune responses.</p>
