The results in this page were generated with repository version

See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made
to the R Markdown and HTML files.

<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for
the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results
(you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or
<code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown
file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it
depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results
were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .DS_Store
    Ignored:    .Rhistory
    Ignored:    analysis/.Rhistory

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not
included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to
have uncommitted changes.

<h3>CEP250</h3>
<p>CEP250, also known as C-Nap1, is a centrosomal protein involved in
centrosome cohesion and cell cycle regulation. Here’s what is known
about its potential role in prostate cancer:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Centrosome Function: CEP250 plays a critical role in maintaining
centrosome cohesion, which is essential for proper cell division.
Disruptions in centrosome function can lead to genomic instability, a
hallmark of cancer.</p></li>
<li><p>Cell Cycle Regulation: By influencing centrosome dynamics, CEP250
is involved in regulating the cell cycle. Alterations in its function
could contribute to uncontrolled cell proliferation in cancer.</p></li>
<li><p>Genomic Instability: Abnormalities in CEP250 expression or
function may lead to centrosome amplification, resulting in aneuploidy
and promoting cancer progression.</p></li>
<li><p>Potential Biomarker: Changes in CEP250 expression levels could
potentially serve as biomarkers for prostate cancer diagnosis or
prognosis, although more research is needed to confirm this.</p></li>
<li><p>Research Opportunities: Further studies are required to
understand the specific role of CEP250 in prostate cancer and its
potential as a therapeutic target.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, while CEP250 is not extensively studied in prostate cancer,
its involvement in centrosome function and cell cycle regulation makes
it a potential area for further investigation.</p>
</div>
<div id="ano7" class="section level3">
<h3>ANO7</h3>
<p>ANO7, also known as TMEM16G, is a gene that has been associated with
prostate cancer. Here are some key points about its role:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Prostate-Specific Expression: ANO7 is predominantly expressed in
prostate tissue, making it a potential target for prostate cancer
