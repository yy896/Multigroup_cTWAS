The results in this page were generated with repository version

See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made
to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for
the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results
(you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or
<code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown
file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it
depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results
were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .DS_Store
    Ignored:    .Rhistory
    Ignored:    analysis/.DS_Store
    Ignored:    analysis/.Rhistory

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not
included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to
have uncommitted changes.

<code>drop_strand_ambig = TRUE</code>.</p>

<p>These plots show the estimated prior inclusion probability, prior
effect size variance, enrichment and proportion of variance explained
(PVE) over the iterations of parameter estimation. The enrichment is
defined as the ratio of the prior inclusion probability of molecular
traits over the prior inclusion probability of variants. We generally
expect molecular traits to have higher prior inclusion probability than
variants. Enrichment values typically range from 20 - 100 for expression
traits.</p>
<p>Then, we use <code>summarize_param(param, gwas_n)</code> to obtain
estimated parameters (from the last iteration) and to compute the PVE by
variants and molecular traits.</p>

<!-- Adjust MathJax settings so that all math formulae are shown using
TeX fonts only; see
https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/web/configuration.html. This will make
the presentation more consistent at the cost of the webpage sometimes
taking slightly longer to load. Note that this only works because the
footer is added to webpages before the MathJax javascript. -->
